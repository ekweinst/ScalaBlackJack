# Blackjack Game in Scala

## Overview
This is a simple implementation of the classic casino game Blackjack, written in Scala. The project was created as a fun exercise for a class assignment.

## Requirements
- Scala 3.2.0 (or later)

## Running the Game
To run the game, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Scala 3.2.0 installed on your system. If not, you can download and install it from the official Scala website: [Scala Lang](https://www.scala-lang.org/).

2. Download or clone this repository to your local machine.

3. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the `blackjack.scala` file.

4. Compile the Scala file using the following command:
   ```bash
   scalac blackjack.scala

5. Once the compilation is successful, run the compiled program with the following command:
   ```bash
   scalac blackjack.scala
6. Enjoy!

## Gameplay
The rules of the game are standard Blackjack rules:

- The player aims to beat the dealer by having a hand value closer to 21 without exceeding it.
- Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) have a value of 10.
- Aces can either be counted as 1 or 11, depending on which value benefits the player more.
- The dealer must draw cards until their hand value is 17 or higher.

## File Structure
blackjack.scala: Contains the main Scala code for the game.

## Credits
This project was created by Emily Weinstein in collaboration with Matthew Maillet and Sebastian Favela for our Scala Term Project as a fun exercise.
